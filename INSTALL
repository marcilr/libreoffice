macBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) running
macOS Sierra v10.12.6


OS X

First check the system requirements[1] before installing LibreOffice on macOS.

o Download the .DMG file from the download page.[2]
o Open the .DMG file by double-clicking on it.

o An installation window appears: drag and drop the LibreOffice icon into
  the Applications folder. You may be required to enter your administrator
  password.

o The files are copied over and a progress bar shows when the installation
   is complete.

o If needed, you may now download and install the language pack(s) of your
  choice and built-in help by downloading the .DMG file of your choice.
  The installation steps are the same than the ones described above but you
  must have downloaded the main LibreOffice .DMG file beforehand.

Users of macOS 10.8 and later versions: if you are running macOS 10.8
(Mountain Lion), you may run into a problem with Apple's new Gatekeeper.
A solution is: the first time you run LibreOffice, right-click
(control-click) the LibreOffice.app icon and choose Open from the
context menu.  You will be asked if you really want to start the
program â€“ confirm this to launch it.  For additional details, you may
find this article[3] helpful.
