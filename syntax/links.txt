unoconv
Universal Office Converter - Convert between any document
format supported by LibreOffice/OpenOffice.
Universal Office Converter (unoconv) is a command line tool to
convert any document format that LibreOffice can import to any
document format that LibreOffice can export.  It makes use of
the LibreOfficeâ€™s UNO bindings for non-interactive conversion
of documents.
For practical reasons we mention LibreOffice, but OpenOffice is
supported by unoconv as well.
